		Hi my name is Joshua Roman and I am a 20 year old native from New York, New York. I am going to be a lower junior at Lehman College and plan on graduating in the Fall of 2019 with a undergraduate degree in Computer Information Systems and Computer Graphics Imaging minor. I run Cross Country/Track for Lehman College, I mainly specialize in the 8000m but run most distance events. I have hobbies such as photography, computer activities, hiking, oragami, wakeboarding, and creative writing.</p>
